# 🧮 Assignment 1 — Module 2: Basic Python Concepts

This repository contains two Python tasks focused on basic programming concepts such as user input, arithmetic operations, and string manipulation.


## 📘 Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

### **Problem Statement**
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2. Performs the following operations:
   - Addition  
   - Subtraction  
   - Multiplication  
   - Division  
3. Displays the result of each operation on the screen.

### **Expected Output**

Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5

Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2.0


### **File Name**
`basic_math_operations.py`


## 💬 Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

### **Problem Statement**
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes a user's **first name** and **last name** as input.  
2. Concatenates them into a **full name**.  
3. Prints a **personalized greeting** using the full name.

### **Expected Output**

Enter your first name: Rahul
Enter your last name: Prasad

Hello, Rahul Prasad! Welcome to the Python program.


### **File Name**

# 🧮 Assignment 2 - Control Structures in Python

## 📘 Module 3: Control Structures in Python

This assignment focuses on using **conditional statements** and **loops** in Python to solve basic computational problems.


## 🧠 Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### 🔹 Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.  
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.  
3. Displays the result accordingly.

### 💻 Example Output:
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.

### **File Name**
`Even_odd.py`


## 🔁 Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

### 🔹 Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.  
2. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.  
3. Displays the final sum.

### 💻 Example Output:

The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275

### **File Name**
`sum_of_integer.py`
